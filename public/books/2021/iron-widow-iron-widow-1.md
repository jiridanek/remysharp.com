Didn't so much smash the patriarchy than slit it's throat and stand over it whilst it bled out!<br /><i></i><br />I couldn't put this down and chomped it down in a matter of days. Great engaging and graphic writing.<br /><br />The book description of a cross between Pacific Rim and Handmaid's Tale is fairly close, though in some ways I can see how this system came to be (women being treated as objects) based on our reality moreso. I suspect this is helped by the author using real Chinese history to inform characters and features of the story.<br /><br />There's some pretty bleak stuff in there, and some refreshing views on relationships and status quo.<br /><br />Really good stuff. Definitely reads like it would relate to the YA audience, but still very engaging for old dudes like me!
