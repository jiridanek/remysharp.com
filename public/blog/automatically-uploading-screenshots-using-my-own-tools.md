# Automatically uploading screenshots using my own tools

Often I'll want to share a screenshot and over the years I've used a number of different tools, but I'm always beholden to when they eventually become unsupported or the company "pivots" and the pricing model goes silly. So after all this time, I finally worked out how to roll my own.

Forewarning though, this is MacOS specific, but I'm sure same thinking can be applied to other operating systems.

<!--more-->

## The spec

I want to be able to take a screenshot and then, without any interaction, have a sharable URL in my clipboard.

The steps to achieve this (on my mac) are:

1. When a new file appears in my screenshot folder, perform an action
2. Read the latest file in the folder and upload to a hosting service
3. Copy the URL of that image to my clipboard

There's a couple of bonus features that I can add to this:

1. Compress the image *first* then upload it
2. Play some kind of notification so I know the upload is complete
3. Only apply this action to new screenshots - not a file I might have renamed

This lose outline gives me the power to use my own screenshot software, whether it be a plain native screenshot, or [shottr](https://shottr.cc/) (which I really like for quick annotations before getting dropped into my screenshot folder). If (or _when_) shottr stops working, my process can still work.

I'm also free to decide how I host the images. For the time being, this is via AWS S3.

Finally, I want a _fancy_ url for the images, so I'll lean on Netlify for this.

## The implementation

I've tried to break this down into readable blocks, but this isn't intended as a copy and paste solution (though you probably could copy all the blocks).

### 1. When a new file appears

I originally tried to achieve this using MacOS's Automator app but frankly I've no idea how it works, where configuration files live or anything.

However, a simpler solution (to me!) is a `WatchPath` service to [monitor a directory for MacOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-SW7-SW8). This means when the directory contents changes, it will let me run a terminal command.

The command I run will then do all the heavy lifting to work out what's changed and what to do:

I created `~/Library/LaunchAgents/upload_screenshot.plist` and registered it with:

```sh
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/upload_screenshot.plist
```

The `upload_screenshot.plist` file contains the following XML (note that `~/Desktop/Screenshots` is where my screenshots land):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN
http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>Upload Screenshot</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>~/bin/upload_screenshot</string>
  </array>
  <key>WatchPaths</key>
  <array>
    <string>~/Desktop/Screenshots</string>
  </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### 2. Doing a thing with that screenshot

What this script does is:

1. if the file hasn't been processed already, then â€“
2. copy the _predicted_ url to the clipboard
3. compress the file (adding `-min.png` to the end)
4. remove the old image
5. upload the file
6. play a notification sound

The file lives in `~/bin/upload_screenshot` (`~` being short hand for my `$HOME` directory), and it has execute properties, i.e. `chmod +x ~/bin/upload_screenshot`.

There's also a few external programs being used:

- `pbcopy` a macos command to copy a string to the clipboard
- `afplay` another macos native command, plays audio - the `Blow.aiff` was just a sound I found in the operating system
- `pingquant` a third party [png compressor](https://pngquant.org/) - it helped upload speeds to compress the image (and of course, bandwidth, costs, etc)
- `aws` the [command line tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to actually run the upload to AWS using a profile I created called `screenshot`

Below is the script itself:

```bash
DIR=/Users/remy/Desktop/Screenshots

# get the latest file
FILE=$(ls -rAt $DIR | tail -n 1)

# if it's a junk file, or it's already processed, exit early
if [[ "$FILE" == .DS_Store ]]; then exit; fi
if [[ "$FILE" == *-min.png ]]; then exit; fi

# copy the URL to the clipboard as early as possible
echo https://remysharp.com/shot/$(basename $FILE .png)-min.png | pbcopy

# compress the original and output as $FILE-min.png
/Users/remy/bin/pngquant $DIR/$FILE --ext -min.png

# remove the original
rm $DIR/$FILE

# upload to AWS under my "screenshot" profile
AWS_PROFILE=screenshot /usr/local/bin/aws s3 cp $DIR/$(basename $FILE .png)-min.png s3://screenshots.remysharp.com

# play tone so I know it's ready
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff
```

### 3. AWS policy

AWS policies always bite me, so I've included it in this write up. I created a bucket called `screenshots.remysharp.com` which the policy below can write to. The policy was created against a new user called `screenshot`.

Note that I also configured the AWS bucket to be public so that when I shared a URL the image could be actually read.

```json
 {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1397632521960",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1397633323327",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::screenshots.remysharp.com/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Fancy URLs

Finally, when the images are uploaded, you might have noticed that I didn't copy the AWS URL (because they're ugly), but a "nice" URL under my own domain.

To achieve this, since my blog (the domain `remysharp.com`) is hosted on Netlify, and Netlify offers a really superb redirect service, I'm able to use their ["splats"](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/#splats) to hide the AWS URL and make it nice.

It also means should I ever move to a new image hosting provider, _and_ I wanted to keep my screenshots, I can keep supporting these URLs as I have full control of them.

In my `_redirects` file I include the following line:

```
/shot/* https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenshots.remysharp.com/:splat 200
```

## There you go
