# A collection of modern/faster alternatives to common unix commands

A great collection of tools similar to my own "CLI improved" post a few years back and includes some tools I use daily already (including `jq`, `bat`, `fd` and `fzf`).

There's some nice additions but the trick is to use them for local tooling and not for shared tools or workflows as it's less likely someone else will have a tool like `sd` installed.

The `dog` and `xh` look particularly interesting to me.
