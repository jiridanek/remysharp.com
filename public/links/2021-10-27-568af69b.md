# Scribe - An alternative frontend to Medium

I hadn't realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I'd had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.

But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - whichâ€¦ is stupid.

Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author's content.

I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium's horrid cruft.

Great example of taking back the web.
